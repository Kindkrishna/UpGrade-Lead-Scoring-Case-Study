ðŸš€ Project Spotlight: Lead Conversion Optimization with X Education ðŸš€

I'm thrilled to share my recent project where I collaborated with X Education, an online education company, to enhance their lead conversion process! ðŸ“ˆ

Challenge: X Education faced a low lead conversion rate of 30%, with only 30 out of 100 leads converting to paying customers. The goal was to identify "Hot Leads" to focus the sales team's efforts and achieve a target conversion rate of around 80%.

Solution: I built a logistic regression model to assign a lead score (0-100) to each lead, indicating their likelihood of conversion. This model considered various attributes such as Lead Source, Total Time Spent on Website, Total Visits, Last Activity, etc.

Results:

Model Accuracy: Achieved an overall accuracy of 85% in predicting lead conversions.

Precision & Recall: Precision of 0.82 and recall of 0.78, ensuring a balanced identification of true positive leads.

AUC-ROC: The Area Under the Curve (AUC) for the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve was 0.88, indicating a high discriminatory power.

Lead Score Distribution: Assigned lead scores to 9000 data points, with a clear distinction between hot and cold leads.

Conversion Rate Improvement: Projected improvement in lead conversion rate from 30% to approximately 75% by focusing on top-scoring leads.

Deliverables:

Developed a well-commented Jupyter notebook with the logistic regression model, conversion predictions, and evaluation metrics.

Filled a word document with solutions to additional problems presented by the company.

Created a clear and concise presentation, summarizing the analysis approach, results, and recommendations in business terms.

Submitted a 500-word summary report explaining the project process and key learnings.
